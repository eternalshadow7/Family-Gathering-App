    <string name="instructions">In this game, you are given topics to re-enact to the other person via live video feed. The oldest gets to start. The other     player will guess by inputting a guess. The guess will be sent back to you translated to whatever language you chose. If that player guessed correctly,     let them know via chat. Let the other person act out the same topic, but this time, you have to guess. If both of you were able to guess     what each of you were acting out, go to the next topic. There is a progress bar in which it will let you know how many you have guessed.     Once it is filled. the game is over.</string>
